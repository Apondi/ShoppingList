# ShoppingList

This project was my first Android app. I created it while did Android classes at [Proway IT Training](http://proway.com.br/).
It's a shopping list app. Here you can create a shopping list, or a to-do list. After adding some items, you can marke them as done.
As a shopping list, you also can apply prices and quantities for your items.
